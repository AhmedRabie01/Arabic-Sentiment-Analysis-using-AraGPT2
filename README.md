# Arabic Sentiment Analysis using Arabic BERT


Welcome to the Arabic Sentiment Analysis project powered by Arabic BERT! This repository contains an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that focuses on analyzing sentiment in Arabic text. Leveraging the power of Arabic BERT, a state-of-the-art language model for the Arabic language, we have built a robust sentiment analysis system capable of understanding and classifying emotions within Arabic text.

# What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is a fascinating area of NLP that involves understanding and classifying the emotions expressed in a given text. It allows us to determine whether a piece of text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, providing valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and more.

The Power of Arabic BERT
BERT, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a groundbreaking NLP model that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. Arabic BERT, specifically tailored for the Arabic language, builds upon this success by enabling us to efficiently comprehend and analyze Arabic text with exceptional accuracy.

# Project Goals
Our primary goal with this project is to provide a comprehensive and reliable Arabic Sentiment Analysis tool. We aim to help researchers, developers, and businesses gain deeper insights into the sentiment of Arabic language content, leading to better decision-making and enhanced understanding of user sentiment.

# Key Features
## Data Ingestion from MongoDB:
We have implemented data ingestion functionalities to fetch Arabic text data from MongoDB, making it easy to work with large datasets efficiently.

## Data Validation and Transformation: 
Prior to model training, we perform data validation and transformation to ensure the dataset is clean, balanced, and suitable for training the sentiment analysis model.

## Fine-tuned Arabic BERT Model: 
We fine-tuned the Arabic BERT model using a large dataset of labeled Arabic text for sentiment analysis. This ensures that the model can accurately capture the nuances of sentiment in Arabic language content.

## Model Training and Evaluation:
The fine-tuned model undergoes extensive training using the prepared dataset. We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## Model Pusher:
Once the model training and evaluation are complete, we implement a model pusher component that allows for easy deployment of the trained model to the web application.

## Web Application Development:
We have developed a FastAPI web service that serves as the backbone of our sentiment analysis application. The web app interacts with the sentiment analysis model and allows users to input Arabic text to obtain sentiment analysis results in real-time.
